# fr3nd-ai

MVP: chat interface with LLM that mimics human behaviour. Use cases include creating context-aware, persistent-memory fine-tuned personas that are able to utilise agents to access current data like timezones. The goal of the modules in the repo are to make fine-tuning a persona as seamless as possible, given raw datasets.

## Modules

- agents
- ingestion
